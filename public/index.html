  <h1>Chicago Freelance Web Developer</h1>
  <h2>Skillsets</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Chicago-based freelance web developer.</br></br>  My skillsets include Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and UX.  This means I can build database-backed <b>social networking sites</b>, along with your textbook websites for businesses.
  </p>

  <p>I also am familiar with <b>lean startup methodologies</b>, key <b>digital marketing</b> concepts including SEO, and the key concepts involved in <b>launching a web startup</b>.</p>
  </p>

  <h2>Minimum Viable Product Projects</h2>
  <p>I gladly help entrepreneurs build out their ideas for a fraction of the price a web development firm would charge.  Building an MVP prototype of your idea allows you to test your idea and gain confidence in the concept before investing large sums of money into it.  Most of the time, web dev companies charge $10k - $15k before they even touch a line of code.  I could have an MVP prototype version of your idea built for a fraction of this depending on the scale of the project.  </p>
